# Placeholder values for the cluster module — the file that makes the render check real.
# `nix flake check` renders the whole surface from here, so a module that stops evaluating, or that
# grows a required value nobody supplies, fails in CI rather than in somebody's cluster.
#
# NOTHING HERE IS REAL. Every namespace, path, name, number, image and device resource is invented
# for this file, and no credential appears in any form — only the NAME of a Secret that would hold
# one.
#
# FOUR DECLARATIONS, chosen to cover the paths that differ in what gets RENDERED rather than
# merely in what evaluates. The first two are two deployments of ONE application, which is not a
# shape anybody would run — an example file is not a cluster, and what they exist to do is exercise
# both halves of every branch:
#
#   - one that anchors a namespace, takes its image as a repository plus a version, sleeps behind a
#     wake front, backs every directory on a node path, fills the hook point its catalogue entry
#     describes, and adds the environment a particular piece of silicon needs;
#   - one that joins that namespace rather than creating a second one, is pinned by digest and
#     therefore carries no version at all, stays resident, reads its weights read-only out of an
#     existing claim instead of off a node — which is the other backing, and the one the existence
#     guard deliberately cannot check — and renames one volume to the name an object it stands in
#     for already carries — and, because that object was already running, is ADOPTED rather than
#     created, which is the one term in this file that changes the Application rather than the pod.
#
# The other two are the voice tier, in a SECOND namespace of its own, and they are here because
# between them they are the only place several branches are taken at all:
#
#   - a workload that does NOT burn the card, so a rendered pod with no device request is something
#     the checks can actually read rather than a claim about an option;
#   - a workload whose catalogue entry publishes no image, so the whole reference is not an
#     override of anything — it is the only image there is, and leaving it out is refused.
