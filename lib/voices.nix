#
# The voice-model catalogue: WHICH speech model a cluster workload serves, and the handful of facts
# that decide whether you can run it.
#
# WHY A SECOND CATALOGUE, and why it is voice-shaped rather than model-shaped in general. The
# applications catalogue next door says what a piece of SOFTWARE is. For most of what runs on the
# card that is the whole story: a node-graph editor is a graph editor whatever checkpoints a
# deployment installs into it, and a catalogue of those checkpoints would be a catalogue of
# CONTENT -- one deployment's library, changing weekly, and no more this repository's than a brush
# preset is. The voice tier is the case where that split does not hold. Each of these applications
# IS one model's server: the model is not content you load into it, it is the thing the image was
# built around, so "which model does this serve" is knowledge about the software and belongs beside
# it. Swapping the model means swapping the workload.
#
# WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR, concretely: making a swap DECIDABLE. The catalogue is deliberately wider
# than what any deployment runs, because the question it answers is never "what is deployed" -- the
# declaration answers that -- but "what would we move to, and what does moving cost". Five facts
# decide that, and they are the only five here: how big the model is, whether it needs a graphics
# device, whether it can clone a voice from a reference sample, what its licence is and whether
# that licence permits commercial use, and where the weights come from.
#
# NOTHING HERE DOWNLOADS ANYTHING, and no path to a weight file appears in this repository. A
# repository id says where weights come FROM; where the file lands on a given machine is a
# deployment's fact, backed through the application's `state` directories like every other one.
# `checks/voices-eval.nix` refuses an absolute path anywhere in this file for exactly that reason.
#
# ── THE EVIDENCE RULE, AND IT IS THE POINT OF THE FILE ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every fact below was read off a primary source -- a model card, a licence text, or a repository
# API -- and every entry carries the URLs it was read from. Where a source does not establish a
# fact, the field is `null` AND the entry names it in `unverified` with what would have to be
# fetched to fill it in. The check enforces that in BOTH directions: a null that is not named is an
# error, and naming a field that is not null is an error too. There is no way to leave a fact out
# quietly, and no way to guess one.
#
# A LICENCE THAT DOES NOT CLEARLY PERMIT COMMERCIAL USE IS THE EXPENSIVE MISTAKE, so it is the one
# fact that cannot be recorded silently: `commercialUse` is a JUDGEMENT and not a boolean -- `yes`,
# `no`, or `conditional` for a licence that permits commercial use while binding what you may do
# with it -- and anything other than `yes` must carry a `caveat` saying what the restriction is.
# Two of the models below have permissive CODE and non-commercial WEIGHTS, which is precisely the
# shape that a reader -- or a scraper keying on a repository's licence tag -- gets wrong.
#
# `gated` IS ABOUT TERMS, NOT ABOUT ENFORCEMENT. It records that the weights are published behind
# an agreement the publisher wrote and expects you to accept, which is a property of the release.
# Whether the hub is mechanically blocking anonymous downloads today is a separate and movable
# thing, and the two disagree in practice -- `experiments/verify-voices.sh` reports both and
# compares only the first, and `studies/` records the run where they came apart.
#
# THE FACTS ROT AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS. A parameter count and a licence are properties of a released
# artifact and do not move. Download counts, star counts and "last pushed" dates are observations,
# and they are kept OUT of this file: where staleness is itself the decision (an upstream that
# stopped moving years ago) the note says so with the date attached, and the underlying numbers
# live in `studies/` where they are dated rather than pretended to be permanent.

          election manipulation and biometric surveillance.

          Read against the licence text rather than the tag: the grant is "for any non-commercial
          purpose", and receiving "any direct or indirect payment arising from the use of the model
          or its output" takes an activity outside it. A commercial entity may use it for testing,
          evaluation and non-commercial research and no further. This is a hard blocker in a
          commercial context and is independent of whether the model is any good.

          AND IT IS A CODE/WEIGHTS SPLIT, the second one in this catalogue: the maintained fork that
          serves these weights is MPL-2.0, an open-source licence, while the weights themselves are
          not. Reading the serving code's licence and stopping there gets this exactly backwards.
