#
# The cluster catalogue: what nixcreative's cluster-side applications ARE.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, and it is the repository's own gate 2 finally landing somewhere.
# The placement rule says a tool whose working set includes model weights is not a package here:
# a package manager can finish installing a raster editor and it cannot finish installing a model.
# That sends the tool to the cluster. It never sent it to another SUBJECT -- generative media is
# this repository's subject on both planes -- so the cluster half belongs here, in a vocabulary
# that describes a workload instead of a workstation.
#
# WHAT BELONGS HERE. The same three gates, with gate 2 answered the other way round: the thing
# still authors a file whose contents only its operator decided (gate 1), it still has a display
# mode (gate 0), and it needs weights (gate 2) -- so it runs as a workload rather than as a
# package. A model SERVER that answers an API and authors nothing is not this repository's on
# gate 1, whatever it is made of; a media library, a transcoder or a capture pipeline is not this
# repository's on gate 1 either, and each of those has an owner already.
#
# WHAT IS KNOWLEDGE AND WHAT IS A VALUE. Everything in this file is true of the software wherever
# anyone runs it: the port it listens on, the directories it reads and writes, whether it burns a
# GPU, whether it authenticates anybody, how patient a probe has to be before it is calling a slow
# start a failure. Nothing here names an address, a node, a hostname, a namespace, a device-plugin
# resource or a card. Those are one deployment's facts and they arrive from the consumer.
#
# THE GPU IS DECLARED AS A NEED AND NEVER AS AN ALLOCATION. `gpu = true` says the process puts
# work on a graphics device. What the cluster CALLS that device, how many there are, who yields it
# and in what order are four different fleet facts, and not one of them is expressible here.
#
# AN IMAGE REFERENCE IS NOT ALWAYS A FACT ABOUT THE SOFTWARE. Where somebody publishes a runnable
# container, naming its repository here is knowledge and a deployment supplies the version. Where
# nobody does -- where upstream ships a Dockerfile written against one vendor's compute runtime and
# every operator builds their own -- there is no reference this repository could state, `image` is
# `null`, and the translator refuses a declaration that does not carry a whole one. That is the
# knowledge/value split reaching the least obvious field rather than an omission.
#
# A HOOK POINT IS THE IMAGE'S, AND ITS CONTENT IS NOT. `hook` describes a path an image reads
# before it starts, the directory that path lives in, and the reason a read-only projection cannot
# be mounted there -- three facts about a packaging, true of it wherever anyone runs it. It carries
# no script, no ConfigMap name and no installer image: what the hook SAYS is content, and content is
# not vocabulary. A deployment that wants one names the object holding it and the image that copies
# it into place, and the translator builds the container. `null` means the image reads no such path.
#
# WHICH MODEL A WORKLOAD SERVES, in `serves`, keyed into `lib/voices.nix`. It is empty for a tool
# that runs whatever weights a deployment installs into it, and it names one for an application
# that IS a model's server -- where the model is what the image was built around rather than
# content loaded into it. The distinction is the whole reason the second catalogue is voice-shaped
# and not a checkpoint list; `lib/voices.nix` opens with it.

        A node-graph front end for diffusion models: you wire samplers, conditioners, loaders and
        post-processing into a graph and execute it, one iteration at a time, looking at what came
        out and changing the graph. The operator sits in that loop continuously, which is why this
        is generative media rather than a job somebody queued -- and it needs weights, which is why
        it is a workload rather than a package.

        IT HOLDS THE WHOLE DEVICE WHILE IT RUNS. A second replica does not halve the queue; it is a
        second claim on one card, and on a cluster that hands the device out by count the second
        pod simply never schedules. Two live copies is never the shape of this workload, and its
        durable directories already say so: a rollout that overlaps the old pod and the new one is
        the new one waiting forever for a device the old one will not release until it is ready.

        AMD CARDS OFTEN NEED A GFX OVERRIDE, and it is not in this catalogue. ROCm ships compiled
        kernels for a short list of GFX targets and refuses a card that is architecturally
        compatible but absent from it; telling the runtime to report a supported target is what
        makes those cards work at all. WHICH target is a fact about a specific piece of silicon,
        so it arrives as environment from the declaration, and a wrong value fails at import time
        rather than quietly.

        THE HOOK POINT IS PART OF THE IMAGE, and worth knowing because the alternative is
        mysterious. This packaging sources `/root/user-scripts/pre-start.sh` on every start when it
        is present, which is the generic answer to a problem custom nodes create: a node cloned
        straight into `custom_nodes/` gets no dependency install, because installing dependencies
        is the in-app node manager's job and a git clone never asked it. That path is INSIDE the
        `home` directory above, which is why `hook` names that directory: the file has to land on a
        volume something backs, or it is gone at the next restart. This repository still plants no
        hook and never will -- what the script SAYS is content, and content is not vocabulary. It
        describes the point, and a deployment names the object that fills it.

        A ROCM TRAP THAT COSTS AN AFTERNOON: several widely-used custom nodes list `onnxruntime-gpu`
        unconditionally in their requirements, with a marker that checks the machine architecture
        and never the vendor. That package is CUDA-only. Installed on an AMD box it replaces a
        working `onnxruntime` and breaks every node that reaches face-analysis or ONNX inference,
        with an import error that names neither the culprit nor the node that pulled it in.

        IT IS SAFE TO SLEEP, and that is a property of the software rather than of its size.
        Nothing in it fires on a timer, nothing watches a directory, and a graph runs only when
        somebody submits one -- so at zero replicas there is no work that fails to happen, which is
        the actual test. WHETHER it sleeps is a deployment's call, and so is what wakes it; the one
        thing this repository will say about the wake path is that a request arriving while the pod
        is down has to be held until the pod holds the card, because a front that admits it earlier
        turns "the device is busy" into an error at the edge.

        AND IT AUTHENTICATES NOBODY. See `authenticates` above: this is the field that decides how
        far it may be exposed, and the module warns rather than refuses only because whether an
        authenticating front sits between it and the world is something a deployment can see and
        this repository cannot.

        Narration. You hand it text and a voice from a fixed set, and it hands back audio -- no
        reference sample, no cloning, nothing about the request that identifies a person. That is a
        smaller act than the one below it, and the smaller act is the one that covers most of the

        judged by listening to it and the reference, the text or the knobs change -- which is what
        makes this generative work rather than a job somebody queued.

        IT HOLDS THE WHOLE DEVICE WHILE IT RUNS, exactly like the graph editor: a second replica is
        a second claim on one card, and on a cluster that hands the device out by count the second
        pod never schedules. Its durable directories say the same thing from the other side.

        A CARD OFTEN NEEDS AN ARCHITECTURE OVERRIDE, and it is not in this catalogue. A compute
        runtime that ships kernels for a short list of targets refuses a card that is compatible
        but absent from the list, and telling it to report a supported target is what makes such a
        card work at all. WHICH target is a fact about one piece of silicon, so it arrives as
        environment from the declaration.

        IT IS SAFE TO SLEEP, and here the case is strong: a pod at zero replicas is a card another
        tenant can have. Nothing fires on a timer and nothing watches a directory, so sleeping
        loses no work; what it costs is the cold start above, paid by whoever wakes it.

        WHAT IS IN THE REFERENCE DIRECTORY IS A PERSON'S VOICE, and that is worth stating in the
        catalogue rather than leaving to a deployment to notice. Two consequences that are facts
        about this application rather than policy: it authenticates nobody, so exposure is the only
        control there is; and the model it serves watermarks its output by default, so a generated
        file remains identifiable as generated -- see `lib/voices.nix`.
