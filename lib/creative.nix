  #
  # A digital audio workstation belongs HERE and not in nixrecord, and the reasoning is the one
  # this repo's gate already states: a DAW authors material whose result is not specified before
  # the work starts -- two people at the same session file produce two different records --
  # whereas nixrecord captures an event that happened. Recording a take is capture; arranging,
  # mixing and mastering it is not.
  #
  # The second reason is structural, and it is why this must not drift into nixrecord later: nixrecord
  # is single-host BECAUSE OF AN ENCODER (only one machine in this estate has an AV1 hardware
  # encoder). Anything filed there inherits that constraint permanently. Authoring is not
  # encoder-bound, so binding a DAW to one machine would be an accident of hardware, not a decision.
  #
  # The operator considered Ardour, Reaper and LMMS and declined all three; Audacity was declined
  # outright and was never a DAW candidate at all. qtractor is the pick -- a light, comprehensible
  # multitrack recorder, chosen on size over the alternatives (qtractor 8.7 MiB vs ardour 105 MiB /
  # reaper 127 MiB).
