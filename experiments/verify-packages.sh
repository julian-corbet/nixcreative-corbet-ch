#
# Re-verify the package catalogue against a real pacman database and a real nixpkgs revision.
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR. `lib/creative.nix` maps one tool to a pacman name and a nixpkgs attribute path,
# and both halves are somebody else's namespace: a package gets renamed, an attribute becomes an
# alias, an entry moves to the AUR. None of that fails an evaluation of this repository, because
# nothing here resolves either name -- the module publishes lists and the host installs from them.
# This is where the names are actually resolved.
#
# THE NIXPKGS HALF FORCES THE ATTRIBUTE, and that is the whole point of doing it this way. A
# renamed attribute in nixpkgs becomes a THROWING ALIAS: `nixpkgs ? oldname` is true, and reading
# anything off it raises. An existence check therefore passes on exactly the entries that are
# broken, which is the worst possible direction for a check to be wrong in. Forcing `.name` is what
# tells the two apart.
#
# THE PACMAN HALF NEEDS A PACMAN. Run it on the Arch-family host whose reconciler consumes
# `archPackages`; anywhere else it says so and skips that half rather than pretending. An AUR entry
# is skipped there too and reported: `pacman -Si` cannot see the AUR, and a failure to find one
# would be a false negative, not a finding.
#
#   ./experiments/verify-packages.sh
#
# EXIT STATUS: 0 when every name that COULD be checked resolved, 1 otherwise. A skip is not a
# failure and is never counted as a pass.
