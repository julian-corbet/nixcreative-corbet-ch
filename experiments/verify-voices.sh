# Re-verify the voice catalogue against the sources it claims to have been read from.
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR. `lib/voices.nix` is a table of facts about somebody else's artifacts, and the
# failure mode it is exposed to is not a typo -- `checks/voices-eval.nix` catches those -- but the
# world moving underneath it. A repository is renamed and the old id redirects; a licence tag is
# corrected; a gate is added or lifted. None of that changes this repository, so none of it fails a
# check, and the entry quietly stops being true. This script is how you find out.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: download weights. Every request is a metadata request -- the model API and
# the repository API -- and the whole point of the catalogue is that this repository says WHICH
# model a workload serves and never where a weight file lives.
#
# IT READS THE CATALOGUE THROUGH NIX rather than parsing it, so it cannot drift from what the flake
# actually exports.
#
#   ./experiments/verify-voices.sh              # every catalogued model
#   ./experiments/verify-voices.sh kokoro-82m   # one of them
#
# EXIT STATUS is the finding: 0 when every catalogued fact still matches its source, 1 when
# anything disagrees. A disagreement is not automatically an error in this repository -- upstream
# may simply have changed -- so it prints what it saw rather than what it expected you to do.
#
# UNAUTHENTICATED, on purpose: everything it reads is public, and a script that needed a credential
# would be one nobody could run. The GitHub API allows 60 unauthenticated requests an hour, which is
# more than this needs and less than you get by running it in a loop.
