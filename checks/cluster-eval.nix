# and MUST render -- without it, a typo in the shared base would make every other case "pass" for
# the wrong reason.
#
# SOME OF THE REFUSALS ARE NOT GUARDS AT ALL. Naming an application the catalogue does not hold,
# saying a workload needs the card, and saying where inside the container a directory lives all fail
# as a type error or an unknown option -- not as assertions. That is the
# stronger kind: a boundary nobody has to remember, because it is unwritable rather than refused.
# `tryEval` cannot tell those apart from a guard, so the ones that ARE guards additionally have
# their message asserted by content.
