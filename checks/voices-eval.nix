# Proves the voice-model catalogue obeys its own evidence rule, and that the two catalogues in
# `lib/` agree with each other.
#
# THIS CHECKS DATA, NOT A MODULE, and that is the right shape for what it protects. Nothing about a
# model's parameter count, its licence or its repository id depends on a declaration, so there is
# no surface to render and no consumer to imagine: the failure mode being defended against is
# somebody adding an entry from memory, or half-updating one, and both of those are visible in the
# data alone.
#
# THE RULE IT ENFORCES IS THE ONE THE CATALOGUE OPENS WITH. Every fact came off a primary source;
# where a source does not establish a fact the field is `null` and the entry names it in
# `unverified` with what would have to be fetched. Both directions are checked, because only one
# direction is a rule you can satisfy by deleting something: an unnamed `null` is a fact quietly
# dropped, and a named field that is NOT null is an entry somebody filled in without removing the
# note saying it was unknown -- which is how a stale "we never checked this" outlives the checking.
#
# AND IT REFUSES A PATH. `lib/voices.nix` says which model a workload serves and never where a
# weight file lives; an absolute path anywhere in that data is one deployment's disk layout
# arriving in a public catalogue, so it fails here rather than being noticed in review.
